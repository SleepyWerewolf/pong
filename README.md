# Pong in TypeScript
Quick and dirty version of Pong written in TypeScript.

Based on [Meth Meth Method's Pong tutorial](https://youtu.be/ju09womACpQ). I wanted to add some more modern build tools and a type system to the game, as well as organize the code a bit better, and thus this was born.

# Note
I got lazy and didn't implement a UI, so you'll need to open up the console to see score and countdowns. Sorry!
